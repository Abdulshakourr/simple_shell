# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
 **By Spencer Cheng, featuring Julien Barbier**
 Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: Godswill Kalu, Vatalis Ibeh)


# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#  General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
# GitHub
*There should be one project repository per group. If you and your partner have a repository with the same name in both your accounts, you risk a 0% score. Add your partner as a collaborator. *

More Info
Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

# files
- README.md - description about the project repo
- man_1_simple_shell - is the man page for the shell we are going to write.
- AUTHORS - file at the  root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. 
- main.h - is the header file which contains the standared header file and prototype of o function used in the program.
- main.c - initialize the program with infinite loop by call the prompt function
- prompt.c - it use getline system call to read the input from the user and run infinite loop with fork to keep prompt going.
- special_character - It identiies if the special inputs such as if the frist input is slash,the user typed exit or env...
- string.c -it handles the strings(string length, write string,find string in directory,concatane strings....)
- cmd.c - it finds the command the user entered.
- execute.c - execute the command.



### What is Shell
A **shell** is a command-line interpreter, it is the computer program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system. Depending on the type of interface they use, shells can be of various types, in this case, a shell program of the type **`sh`** ([Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)) will be developed. Users typically interact with a shell using a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) that is used for entering data into and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.

### What is it for
This consists of interpreting orders. It incorporates features such as process control, input/output redirection, law listing and reading, protection, communications, and a command language for writing batch programs or scripts. All Unix-type systems have at least one interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program is found within the Unix file hierarchy at **`/bin/sh`**.


### Tasks

* Task 0. README, man, AUTHORS
